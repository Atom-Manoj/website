      <h3>ABSTRACT </h3>
      <p>Heavy metals are broad category of naturally occurring elements whose molecular weight and densities  is grater then those of water  occur. These elements play an important role in our body but excess of them is certainly harmful . While others are inherently hazardous (arsenic , lead ,cadmium and mercury) . All organisms possess certain metal detoxification processes . Seventy-five samples from both the genders are taken having age (15-70) years .  50 patients having blood disease were selected from Teaching Al Diwaniyah hospital and 25 appeared healthy control group . Heavy metal parameter measurement was performed on blood serum . blood serum was then examined to observe total study sample of heavy metal  based on occupation employees constituted highest percentage (36%) reflecting the working condition . Studies shows that exposure to heavy metal can lead to carcinogenic effect and increase in chances of cancer . It is found that 60% of participants does not have genetic disease reflecting effect of environment and working condition (exposure to heavy metal ) and determine the relationship between this exposure and the incidence of Leukaemia .  </p>
      <h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>
      <p>Metal elements with density grater then water are heavy metals. Metal that are heavy can be distinguished as their weight and density is no less than five times that of water. Heavy metal also includes metalloid which can be harmful even in minimal amount such as arsenic(As). At low concentration iron , manganese , zinc ,copper and other metals that are heavy in weight are vital for human survival but in high concentration they can be harmful . Other heavy metals including lead , mercury, arsenic are of no biological use . Just like other metal they becomes harmful when attained in certain amount . It might be difficult to confirm the diagnosis of elemental toxicity as it is confused with several non-elemental dependent illness . </p> 
      <br>
      <p>Elevated concentration of heavy metal in body can lead to negative impact on haematological health and  elevate the risk of developing haematological disorders . Leukaemia is a malignant illness characterised by excessive development of immature white blood cells. From 2015 to 2019 there is rise in 14.1 new leukaemia cases and 6.1 leukaemia related death per 100,000 individual. Approximately 1.5% individual may receive diagnosis for leukaemia in their lifetime .  It has grater prevalence in men as compared to women .Also leukaemia  cases are greater in high income as compared to low income countries . The primary risk factor for leukaemia are radiation, prior treatment, chemical exposure, tobacco use, haematological disease, age and sex. </p> 
      <br>

      <p>There are four classification of leukaemia including acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).certain risk factors are strongly related to certain leukaemia subtypes. Life span study(LSS) of Japanese survivors shows that exposure to radiations elevates the risk of cancer . It is well known that using heavy metal in certain industries and products like alloys and colour pigments can lead to workers being exposed to these metals. The main way that heavy metals are harmful is by making reactive species of oxygen which can cause damage through oxidation. While acute poisoning is caused by inhaling dust , fumes or vapours at work . Metal those are heavy can always get into body via nourishment, air, water. Heavy metal may effect bloodstream, brain, lung function and other organs of the body.  </p>
      <br>

      <p>Although there is strong epidemiological evidence linking various metals to leukaemia and other illnesses, the baseline levels of both essential and toxic metals in leukaemia patients—and their potential role in treatment—remain unclear. To explore this, researchers at Hospice Civil de Lyon in northern France conducted a study using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. They analysed serum samples from both untreated acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and healthy individuals, focusing on trace metals and copper isotope ratios. A composite metal score was developed for AML patients, and survival outcomes were assessed in relation to metal levels. The study included samples from 67 AML patients and 94 healthy controls. The objective was to evaluate differences in metal concentrations and determine their impact on patient survival.</p>
      <h3>What are the sources of heavy metals ? </h3>
      <p>Natural sources- natural process like erosion of rocks lead to discharge of these heavy metals. These minerals can be found in rain drops that collect on ground. Volcanic eruption can also lead to acid rain that contain lots of heavy metals and in most of the cases hazards of these heavy metals is grater then benefits. For example Hexavalent chromium is found to be carcinogenic on other hand trivalent chromium is good for you. </p>
      <br>

      <p>Anthropogenic sources-wide range of sources such as oil refineries, industries, tanneries, fertilizer and pesticide companies , steel plants ,gasoline and many other are causing pollution in environment which contain heavy metal. Industrial waste discharge into river can or aquatic bodies and lead to elevation in amount of certain components in water </p>
      <h3>Heavy metals analysis:</h3>
      <p>Heavy metal measurement was performed on blood serum by atomic spectrophotometer model Buck scientific 210VGP Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer. One millilitre of blood serum of was taken in test tube and in this one millilitre of strong nitric acid is added and allowed to stand for 24 hours. Nitric acid that is and peroxide of hydrogen are combined in a 1:2 at a room temperature of 70degrees and allowed to react for two hours. Until the solution clarifies then the samples were diluted with deionized water to 10ml and filtration with 0.45 micro pore filter paper . Subsequently samples that had been digested were analysed using atomic absorption to determine concentration of heavy metal. </P>
      <br>

      <p>The findings of the current study indicated that 12% individual had severe myeloid leukaemia, 4% had severe myeloid leukaemia and 8% had acute lymphocytic leukaemia, 32% with chronic myeloid leukaemia, 12% with myeloid, 12% with thalassemia while the control group was 20% from the total percentage. </p>

      <p>The findings of the current study  also indicated that 36% of participants were employees, 20% were freelancers, 20% were students, and 24% housewives. </p>
      <h3>Impact of job on concentration of heavy metals </h3>
      <p>The result of present investigation shows substantial differences in the impact of occupation on the concentration of Pb and Al in the blood . the significant differences may be an early indicator of the disease that workers serum adiponectin levels are lowered by occupational exposure to heavy metals, such as lead . Of all the metals exposures lead has the most detrimental effect on decreased adiponectin levels. Exposure to lead from paint and other jobs leads to its accumulation in bones that eventually gets discharged into blood . </p>
      <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
      <p>This research sheds light on a vital but frequently ignored link between our environment, our DNA, and our general health—particularly in the case of severe blood disorders such as leukaemia and thalassemia. It's tempting to think that illnesses are the result of one factor alone—bad luck, a bug, or perhaps genes—but the reality is usually different. What this study demonstrates is that the metals we're exposed to every day can sneakily accumulate in our bodies and lead to long-term health issues. </p><br>

      <p>The results of the findings regarding how much higher the levels of lead and aluminium were in patients with haematological diseases—and even higher still in individuals with specific jobs or a family history—should be an alarm call. It's not about one individual falling ill; it's about a pattern that infects entire communities and potentially even future generations. The idea of epigenetic modifications—where environmental exposures can turn certain genetic switches on and off—putting additional layers to the narrative. Even once the outside exposure has ended, the biological alterations may persist, affecting not only our health, but possibly that of our children as well. <p><br>

      <p>We tend to imagine pollution and exposure to toxic substances as an issue "out there," but this research brings it into focus. If a person works in manufacturing, construction, or any occupation where they're frequently around metals such as lead or aluminium, they're not only making a living—they may unwittingly be damaging their health in the long run. And if that individual also has a genetic predisposition, the threat could be amplified. </p><br>

      <p>But the good news is: it's not a lost cause. The fact that heavy metal exposure is involved in these diseases provides us with an opportunity to do something about it. It underscores the need for preventive action in the form of safer working conditions, routine health check-ups, protective equipment on hazardous jobs, and more stringent regulations regarding workplace safety. It also tells us why public education is so important—because people can't guard against something they don't even know they have to guard against.</p><br> 

      <p>For individuals with a familial history of blood disease, paying attention to environmental exposure becomes crucial. Small changes—such as avoiding identified sources of heavy metal, having clean drinking water, or asking physicians for regular screening—can have a significant impact. </p><br>

      <p>Ultimately, this study conveys a bigger message: our health isn't predetermined in our genes. It is influenced by where we live, what we do, and even what our parents and grandparents were exposed to. By learning about these relationships and taking them seriously, we can work toward a future with fewer people afflicted by preventable diseases—and where science, policy, and public understanding combine to keep us all safe. </p>
