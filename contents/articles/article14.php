    <h3>About the mission </h3>
    <p>Axiom Mission 4 (Ax-4) was a private crewed spaceflight to the International Space Station 
(ISS) operated by Axiom Space in collaboration with SpaceX and NASA. The mission was set in 
motion atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket, which placed the Crew Dragon Grace 
spacecraft into low Earth orbit. This was the maiden flight of Grace (C213), and the fifth Crew 
Dragon capsule that has been built. <br><br>
The launch was originally scheduled to happen on June 11, 2025, from Launch Complex 39A at 
the Kennedy Space Centre, but was abandoned due to a liquid oxygen leak. A separate leak in 
the ISS’s Zvezda module caused another two-week launch delay. Finally, the mission was 
launched on June 25,2025 for an 18-day stay at the ISS before undocking and splashing down 
in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of San Diego on July 15,2025.   </p>

<h3>About the Crew </h3>
<p>The four-person crew consisted of commander Peggy Whitson, an Axiom Space employee and 
former NASA astronaut; pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of the Indian Space Research Organisation 
(ISRO); and mission specialists Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski, a European Space Agency 
(ESA) project astronaut from Poland, and Tibor Kapu, from the Hungarian Space Office. 
<br><br>
The mission represented the first state-sponsored human spaceflight in more than four decades 
for India, Hungary and Poland, marking only their second chance overall. Earlier, each of these 
nations had sent a single astronaut into space through the Soviet Union’s Interkosmos program. 
Unlike those missions, which involved docking with the Salyut 6 or Salyut 7 space stations, this 
mission Ax-4, was the first ever government-based initiative from any of the three countries to 
reach the International Space Station (ISS). Remarkably, Shubhanshu Shukla became the first 
astronaut from India’s official space program to journey into space.</p>

<h3>Gaganyaan </h3>
<p>The Axe-4 mission marks an important step forward for India’s Human Spaceflight Programme 
and complements ISRO’s Gaganyaan project. Although Gaganyaan is India’s own crewed 
space initiative, Axe-4 offers the first chance for an Indian astronaut, Shubhanshu Shukla, to 
participate in a commercial spaceflight to the International Space Station (ISS). During this 
mission, Shukla carried out experiments outlined by ISRO and Indian research bodies, primarily 
focusing on areas such as the cognitive effects of screen exposure, microbial behaviour in 
space, muscle degradation, and crop strength under microgravity conditions. <br><br>
ISRO highlighted that the mission provided valuable hands-on experience in crucial aspects, 
including coordination among astronauts and ground teams, real-time health monitoring, 
psychological and medical training, integration with international crew members, and managing 
scientific tasks in space. This experience is expected to directly contribute to increasing 
astronaut training, upgrading safety protocols, and refining mission planning for future 
endeavours under India’s Human Spaceflight Programme.</p><br>
